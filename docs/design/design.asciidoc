=== Stitching multiple images together

The main activities needed to implement _stitch_ is to determine the output file dimensions followed by writing the input images' data at the expected coordinates.
Obviously the concept of coordinates does not exist for most, if not all, image formats, so they need to be converted to buffer offsets.
